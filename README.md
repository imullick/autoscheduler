# autoscheduler

Made this fun project in college with a friend!

Problem Statement – 

In our project, we have developed a bash code for MacOS that makes joining online classes/meetings easy. All you have to do is update the given .csv file with all your scheduled meetings – the day, time, link and any notes, and run the bash code in your terminal. The program will display your schedule for the day and join the link at the specified time. 

Additionally, you may also set reminders for the day. Assignment submission? Enter the details in the file and open the terminal to see all reminders. All your day’s work in one place. Want to resume studying after a 15 minute break? Instruct the code to open the app (E.g. – PowerPoint), or simply just shout out “Its time, go back to studying!”. 

In short, it is a fun scheduling program, and we hope that you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed making it!
